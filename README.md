# freeDSP-KiCadLibrary
KiCad libraries to be used for new designs. All symbols and footprints are checked for correctness. 

If you need to use a new symbol or footprint push it as a commit to the fdsp_new.lib for symbols or fdsp_new.mod for footprints. New commits will be checked for correctness and merged to the libraries as fast as possible.
